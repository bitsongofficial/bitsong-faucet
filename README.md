This application enables the users to receiver coins on the Bitsong Testnet. It can be called  through simple HTTP GET requests,
whose  single query parameter is the address of the wallet who wants to receive the coins.

It is empowered by an anti-bruteforce attack system and a jobs queue built on Redis.

It is also possible to see a documentation for the available APIs at ```/api```.
## üöÄ Tech Stack

**Server:** NestJS, Node.js, Redis and Swagger

**Benchmark:** Python
